Some fixes to heteroscedasticity include transforming the dependent variable and adding features that target the poorly-estimated areas. For example, if a model tracks data over time and model error variance jumps in the September to November period, a binary feature indicating season may be enough to resolve the problem.

If normality is a model-assumption (and it often is), then non-normal variables can sometimes be transformed into normally-distributed features using transformations such as taking the square root, the inverse, or the log of the variable.
